# Contributing

When it comes to open source, there are different ways you can contribute, all
of which are valuable. Here's few guidelines that should help you as you prepare
your contribution.

## Initial steps

Before you start working on a contribution, create an issue describing what you want to build. It's possible someone else is already working on something similar, or perhaps there is a reason that feature isn't implemented. The maintainers will point you in the right direction.

## Development

The following steps will get you setup to contribute changes to this repo:

1. Fork this repo.

2. Clone your forked repo: `git clone git@github.com:{your_username}/prisma-extension-random.git`.

3. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.

4. Create a new branch off the `main` branch: `git switch -c your-feature-name`.

5. Implement your contributions, and push your branch to the repo: `git push origin your-feature-name`.

6. Go to https://github.com/nkeil/prisma-extension-random and select the branch you just pushed in the "compare:" dropdown.

7. Submit the PR. The maintainers will follow up ASAP.
